# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate and dedicated gLua developer with a lot of experience regarding the quirks of the Source Engine, along that I have a lot of experience regarding map creations and server management. I'm currently working on a project called [Minerva Servers](https://minerva-servers.com/discord) which is my own personal Garry's Mod community that I've been working on for the past 3 years.

## My Projects
- [Minerva Servers](https://minerva-servers.com/discord) - My own personal Garry's Mod community that I've been working on for the past 3 years.
- [Garry's Strike](https://github.com/riggs9162/counterstrike) - A Counter-Strike gamemode for Garry's Mod that I started back in new years of 2024. I haven't worked on it in a while but I'm planning on picking it back up soon.
- [Lambda Wars Enhancement](https://github.com/riggs9162/lambdawars-enhancement) - A mod for Lambda Wars that adds new units, buildings, and more to the game.
- [Dynamic Flashlight System](https://github.com/riggs9162/dynamic-flashlight-system) - A addon for Garry's Mod that adds a dynamic flashlight system to the game.
- [Helix Framework Plugins](https://github.com/riggs9162/RiggsHelixPlugins) - A collection of plugins for the Helix Framework that I've made over the years, this is where I mainly started actually learning Lua. I've improved the code quality a lot since then.

- [impulse Framework Schemas](https://github.com/riggs9162/RiggsImpulseSchemas) - A small collection of schemas for the impulse Framework.

## My Skills

- **Garry's Mod** - I have a lot of experience with Garry's Mod and I know how to make a lot of things in it.
- **Lua** - Growing up while playing Garry's Mod I've always been interested in the creation of addons and gamemodes for the game, this is where I started learning Lua.
- **Server Management** - Due to running my own community for the past 3 years (and also some other communities before that) I have a lot of experience with server management.
